# ☸️ Internal Developer Platform on Kubernetes

### The platform *around* the app — not just another deployed app.

**GitOps delivery · self-driving canary releases · full observability · layered security ·<br/>chaos-tested resilience · and a custom Kubernetes Operator written in Go.**

## 💡 The idea

Most Kubernetes projects stop at *"I deployed an app."*

This project is everything a real company builds **around** the app — the internal platform that lets a whole team ship safely: automated deployment from Git, releases that judge themselves against live metrics, centralized monitoring and logging, policy enforcement at the cluster door, autoscaling proven under real load, and on-demand preview environments powered by an operator I wrote myself.

To prove the platform is **app-agnostic**, it runs two completely unrelated workloads with zero platform changes:

| Workload | What it is | Why it's here |
|---|---|---|
| 🛒 **Online Boutique** | Google's 11-service polyglot microservices demo | A realistic, non-trivial app *I deliberately didn't write* — in platform engineering, the app is the workload; **the platform is the project** |
| 📟 **Podinfo** | A tiny Go web service | Proof that a second, unrelated app onboards with no platform changes |

**Same manifests run locally (kind) and in the cloud (k3s on Azure)** — only the host changes. That's the point of declarative infrastructure.

## ⭐ The standout: a custom Kubernetes Operator

I extended the Kubernetes API with my own resource type — and wrote the Go controller that reconciles it.

**A developer writes 7 lines:**

```yaml
apiVersion: platform.myproject.io/v1
kind: PreviewEnvironment
metadata:
  name: pr-42
spec:
  prNumber: 42
  image: nginx:1.27
```

**…and the operator does the rest:**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Dev as 👨‍💻 Developer
    participant API as ☸️ Kubernetes API
    participant Op as ⭐ Operator (Go controller)

    Dev->>API: kubectl apply PreviewEnvironment pr-42
    API-->>Op: watch event → Reconcile()
    Op->>API: create Namespace preview-pr-42
    Op->>API: create Deployment (image from spec)
    Op->>API: create Service
    Op->>API: create Ingress → pr-42.localtest.me
    Note over Op: 🌐 isolated preview env, live at its own URL

    Dev->>API: kubectl delete PreviewEnvironment pr-42
    API-->>Op: deletion blocked by finalizer
    Op->>API: delete namespace (cascades everything)
    Op->>API: remove finalizer → object deleted
    Note over Op: 🧹 zero orphaned resources
```

This is the **same reconciliation pattern Kubernetes itself is built on** — a declared desired state, and a control loop that makes reality match it. Idempotent reconcile, finalizer-based cleanup, least-privilege RBAC generated from Kubebuilder markers.

> The real-world use case: every pull request gets its own isolated, disposable copy of the app at its own URL — the feature you know from Vercel/Netlify previews, built here on raw Kubernetes.

## 🚀 Releases that judge themselves

New versions don't ship all at once — and no human decides whether they're healthy. **Prometheus does.**

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["🚢 New version<br/>deployed"] --> B["25% of traffic<br/>to canary"]
    B --> C{"🔬 AnalysisRun<br/>queries Prometheus:<br/>success rate ≥ 95%?"}
    C -- "✅ healthy" --> D["Auto-promote<br/>50% → 75% → 100%"]
    C -- "❌ degraded" --> E["🤖 Auto-rollback<br/>to last good version"]
    D --> F["✔ Stable"]
    E --> F
```

Two independent safety nets:
- **Metric gate** — an `AnalysisTemplate` runs a live PromQL query (non-5xx ÷ total requests) against real traffic; one failed check aborts and rolls back
- **Health gate** — `progressDeadlineAbort` + readiness probes catch versions that never even become healthy

## 🛡️ Security: defense in depth

Four layers, at four different stages of a container's life — no single control has to be perfect, because there's another one behind it.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph build["🔨 Build time"]
        trivy["Trivy<br/>CVE image scanning"]
    end
    subgraph deploy["🚪 Deploy time"]
        kyv["Kyverno<br/>admission policy:<br/>reject :latest tags"]
    end
    subgraph run["⚡ Runtime"]
        falco["Falco<br/>detects shells in pods,<br/>suspicious syscalls"]
    end
    subgraph access["🔑 Access"]
        rbac["RBAC<br/>read-only dev identity,<br/>no secrets access"]
    end
    build --> deploy --> run
```

The Kyverno policy is enforced live — `kubectl run test --image=nginx` (untagged → `:latest`) is **rejected at admission** and never reaches the cluster.

## 📈 Proven, not assumed

Claims are cheap. Every resilience property here is **demonstrated**:

- **Autoscaling** — a k6 load test ramps 100 virtual users against the shop; the HPA scales the frontend from 1 → 10 pods as CPU crosses the 50% target, then scales back down after the stabilization window. Watched live.
- **Self-healing** — Chaos Mesh kills the frontend pod on purpose; Kubernetes schedules a replacement in seconds while the Service keeps routing to healthy pods.
- **Slow-dependency chaos** — injected 2s network latency (the failure mode far more common than a clean crash) to observe degradation behaviour.
- **Disaster recovery** — when my local cluster's certificates corrupted, I rebuilt the *entire* platform in minutes with one script. Cattle, not pets.

## 🔥 Debugging war stories (the part tutorials skip)

Real things that broke while building this — and how I fixed them:

| Incident | Root cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| **Grafana crash-looping, 432 restarts** | Two datasources (Prometheus + Loki) both provisioned with `isDefault: true` — Grafana refuses to start | Read the container logs → found the provisioning error → patched the Loki ConfigMap to `isDefault: false` |
| **Entire local cluster unreachable** (`x509: certificate signed by unknown authority`) | kind pins the node IP; Docker network changed it after a reboot | Rebuilt the whole platform from `setup.sh` in minutes — the recovery story that proves reproducibility |
| **ArgoCD install failed** (`metadata.annotations: Too long`) | Huge CRDs exceed the annotation limit used by client-side apply | `kubectl apply --server-side` |
| **Canary analysis inconclusive** | Deployed before Prometheus had scraped any traffic — `rate(...[1m])` over no data | Generate load first, wait a scrape cycle, then roll out |

> Every one of these taught me more than the happy path did. **Read the logs, don't guess.**

---

## 🖥️ Quick start — one command

```bash
bash setup.sh
```

Provisions the entire platform from scratch: kind cluster → ingress-nginx → metrics-server → ArgoCD → all apps (via GitOps) → Prometheus + Grafana → Loki → Kyverno → Falco → Chaos Mesh.

Then start the operator:

```bash
cd operator && make install && make run
```

## ☁️ Cloud deployment

The platform also runs on a **k3s cluster on an Azure VM**, behind a real domain, with **automatic Let's Encrypt TLS** via cert-manager (ACME HTTP-01). Same manifests as local — only the ingress host changes.

## 🧭 What this is — and isn't

**This is a portfolio platform, not a production system with real users** — and I think saying that clearly matters.

What it *is*: an end-to-end platform I designed, wired, broke, and fixed myself. Every tool is here for a reason I can defend, every capability is demonstrated live rather than claimed, and the whole thing rebuilds from scratch with one script.

**Roadmap to productionize it** (I know exactly what's missing):
- **Terraform** for the Azure infrastructure — the cluster is declarative; the VM should be too
- **CI pipeline** (GitHub Actions): build → test → Trivy scan → push → GitOps image bump
- Deploy the operator **in-cluster** (`make deploy`) with a `status` subresource and webhook-driven PR lifecycle
- Secrets management (External Secrets / Sealed Secrets) · NetworkPolicies · multi-node HA
